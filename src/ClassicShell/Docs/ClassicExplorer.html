<h1><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/classicshell/"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 64px; height: 64px;" alt="Classic Shell on Source Forge" title="Classic Shell on Source Forge" src="ClassicExplorer_files/ClassicShell.png"></a>&nbsp; Classic Explorer</h1>


<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(79, 129, 189);">Classic
Explorer</span> is a plugin for Windows Explorer that:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Replaces the copy UI in Vista and Windows 7 with the more
user-friendly &#8220;classic&#8221; version from Windows XP</li>
  <li>Handles Alt+Enter in the folder panel of Windows Explorer and
shows the properties of the selected folder</li>
  <li>Adds an Up button in the toolbar</li>
</ul>

<h1>New copy UI</h1>

In Vista when you copy files and there is a conflict you are presented
with this:<br>

<br>

<img style="width: 460px; height: 472px;" alt="Before" title="Before" src="ClassicExplorer_files/before.png"><br>

<p>What&#8217;s wrong with it?</p>

<p>Well, for
starters it is half a screen full of text that you have to read. Also
it is not immediately clear what parts of it are clickable. You have to
move the mouse around to discover the UI like in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Tentacle">Lucas Arts
adventure game</a>. And finally the keyboard usability is awful. To
tell it
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(79, 129, 189);">&#8220;yes, I know what I&#8217;m doing, I want to overwrite all files&#8221;</span> you have to
press <strong><span style="color: rgb(79, 129, 189);">Alt+D, up, up, up, Space</span></strong>! It is harder than performing the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AErqKebdqjU&amp;feature=fvw">Akuma
Kara Demon move</a> in Street Fighter 3. There is a time and a place
for
that stuff and copying files is not it.</p>

<p>The Classic Explorer plugin brings back the simpler dialog box from Windows XP:<br>
</p>

<p><img style="width: 438px; height: 251px;" alt="After" title="After" src="ClassicExplorer_files/after.png"><br>
</p>

<p>It
is immediately clear what is clickable (clue &#8211; the buttons at the
bottom), there is easy keyboard navigation (press <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(79, 129, 189);">Y</span> for &#8220;Yes&#8221;, <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(79, 129, 189);">A</span> to
copy all files) and you can still see which file is newer and which is
larger. And of course just like in Windows XP, holding down <strong style="color: rgb(79, 129, 189);">Shift</strong> while clicking on the No button means "No to All" (or just press <strong style="color: rgb(79, 129, 189);">Shift+N</strong>).<br>
</p>

<p>If you click
on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">More&#8230;</span> you will get
the original dialog from Windows. From there you
will see all the details and you&#8217;ll get an extra option to &#8220;Copy, but
keep both files&#8221;.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</span> Only the UI is replaced. The underlying system that does the actual copying is not affected.<br>
</p>


<h1>Alt+Enter in the folder panel</h1>

Alt+Enter is
universal shortcut across Windows to bring up the properties of the
selection. But in Vista and Windows 7 it doesn&#8217;t work in the left
panel that shows the folders. It works fine on the right where the
files are. This is broken compared to Windows XP where Alt+Enter works
in both places.
<p>To solve the
problem, the Classic Explorer plugin detects when you press Alt+Enter
and shows the properties for the currently selected folder.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h1>Up button in Windows Explorer</h1>

Windows
Explorer in Vista doesn&#8217;t have the button that goes up one folder. The
breadcrumbs in the address bar kind of compensate for that but not
fully. Sometimes you just want to go up 3 folders, and counting 3
breadcrumbs can be a bother.
<p>To solve the problem, the Classic Explorer plugin adds a new toolbar
that has an Up button:<br>
</p>

&nbsp;<img style="width: 483px; height: 125px;" alt="Explorer Toolbar" title="Explorer Toolbar" src="ClassicExplorer_files/toolbar.png"><br>
<br>
Hold the <strong>Control key</strong> when clicking the Up button to open the parent folder in a new Explorer window.<br>

<br>

The new toolbar doesn&#8217;t show up in Explorer automatically after
installation. You have to do 3-4 things before you can use it:<br>

<ol style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

  <li>Open a new Windows Explorer window (Win key+E)</li>
  <li>Turn on the menu in Explorer &#8211; Go to Tools (Alt+T), Folder
Options, the View tab, and make sure &#8220;Always show menus&#8221; is checked.</li>
  <li>Right click on the menu bar and select &#8220;Classic Explorer Bar&#8221; to
show the toolbar.</li>
  <li>If that option is not available (you only see &#8220;Lock the
Toolbars&#8221;) you may have to enable the plugin from Internet Explorer.
Run IE, right click on its toolbar and select &#8220;Classic Explorer Bar&#8221;.
It will ask you if you want to enable this add-on. Select &#8220;Enable&#8221;,
then repeat steps 1 through 3 again.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1>Settings</h1>

The second
button in the toolbar opens up the Settings dialog box for Classic
Explorer. From there you can enable or disable the Copy UI and the
Alt+Enter features.<br>
<br>

<h1>Localization</h1>

The user
interface (except the Settings dialog box) is localized in all 35
languages available for Vista and Windows 7. New languages can be added
by editing the file <span style="color: rgb(79, 129, 189); font-weight: bold;">ExplorerL10N.ini</span>
in the installation folder &#8211;
usually <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(79, 129, 189);">C:\Program
Files\ClassicShell</span>. <br>
