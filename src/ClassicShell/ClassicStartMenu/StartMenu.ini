; This file contains the extra customization options that don't fit in the Settings box. Before changing any of them read the
; description carefully.
; Lines in this file that start with ; (semicolon) are ignored.
;
; Note: After modifying this file most of the settings will be applied the next time you open the start menu. Few settings like "SmallIconSize"
; require a restart of the Classic Start Menu. Right-click on the start button and select "Exit". Then run ClassicStartMenu.exe again.
; Another Note: Unlike the regular settings, which are per user, the settings in this file affect all users.
