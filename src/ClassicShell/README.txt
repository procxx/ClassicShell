Classic Explorer is a plugin for Windows Explorer that:

*	Replaces the copy UI in Vista and Windows 7 with the more user-friendly "classic"
  version similar to Windows XP

*	Handles Alt+Enter in the folder panel of Windows Explorer and shows the properties
  of the selected folder

*	Adds a toolbar to Explorer for some common operations (Go to the parent folder,
