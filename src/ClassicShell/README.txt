CLASSIC SHELL

Classic Shell adds some missing features to Windows 7 and Vista like a
classic start menu, Up button in Explorer and others.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1) Classic Start Menu

The Classic Start Menu is a clone of the start menu from Windows 2000, XP and
Vista that sadly is missing from Windows 7. It has a variety of advanced features:

*	Drag and drop to let you organize your applications

*	Options to show Favorites, expand Control Panel, etc

*	Shows recently used documents. The number of documents to display is customizable

*	Translated in 35 languages, including Right-to-left support for Arabic and Hebrew

*	Does not disable the original start menu in Windows. You can access it by
  Shift+Click on the start button

*	Right-click on an item in the menu to delete, rename, sort, or perform other tasks

*	Available for 32 and 64-bit operating systems

2) Classic Explorer

Classic Explorer is a plugin for Windows Explorer that:

*	Replaces the copy UI in Vista and Windows 7 with the more user-friendly "classic"
  version similar to Windows XP

*	Handles Alt+Enter in the folder panel of Windows Explorer and shows the properties
  of the selected folder

*	Adds an Up button in the toolbar (for navigating to the parent folder)
