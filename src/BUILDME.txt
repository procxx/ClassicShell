To build Classic Shell, navigate to the ClassicShellSetup folder and run __MakeFinal.bat.
It will compile the binaries, produce installer for English, and create the final archives.
Then you can run the individual language files like _BuildFrench.bat to create the installers
for other languages.
The final files (installers, archives) are saved to the ClassicShellSetup\Final folder.

You need the following tools:
Visual Studio 2008
Windows SDK 7.1
HTML Help Workshop
WiX 3.7
It is possible to convert the projects to newer versions of Visual Studio and newer SDKs.
Newer versions of WiX will probably work fine.

Note: Unlike the official release, the source code does not contain digital certificate and
produces unsigned binaries.
